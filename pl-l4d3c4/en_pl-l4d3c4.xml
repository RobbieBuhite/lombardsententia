          Here it is asked, 
          whether baptism would be true, 
          if it were said in the name of the Father alone 
          or of the Holy Spirit alone, 
          as it is when it is said in the name of Christ.

          <name ref="#Ambrose">Ambrose</name> seems to say, 
          that if the mystery of the Trinity is held by faith, 
          and only one person is named,
          then it is a true sacrament, 
          and conversely, 
          if three names are mentioned, 
          but one does not believe rightly about one of them, 
          the mystery becomes empty. 
          For he says the following:
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-Qd1e123">
              Where there is not the full sacrament of baptism 
              neither the beginning nor some species of baptism is estimated. 
              But the fullness is present, 
              if the Father and the Son and the Holy spirit are acknowledge. 
              If you deny one, you ruin the whole.
              And just as if you comprehend one in a word, either Father
              <pb ed="#Qb" n="757"/>
              or Son, or Holy Spirit 
              but in faith you deny neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Sirit, 
              then the Sacrament is full of faith; 
              thus also, 
              though you say the Father and Son and Holy Spirit,
              but you diminish the power of the Father 
              or the Son 
              or the Holy Spirit, 
              then every mystery is empty.

              Since it is said in the name of Christ, 
              the mystery is filled through the unity of the name;

              Now let us consider, 
              whether, 
              just as we read in the name of Christ 
              that the sacrament of baptism is full, 
              so also when called upon the name of the Holy Spirit alone, 
              nothing is lacking for the fullness of the mystery. 
              Let us follow reason. 
              Whoever said one, signified the Trinity; 
              if you say Christ, you have designated both the Father, by whom the Son was anointed, 
              and the Son who himself was anointed,  
              and the Holy Spirit, in whom he was anointed.
              For it has been written
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-Qd1e136" source="http://scta.info/resource/act10_38">
                  This is Jesus of Nazarath, 
                  who God anointed in the Holy Spirit

              And if you say the Father, you are indicating 
              equally his Son and the Spirit of his mouth, 
              but only if you comprehend that in your heart. 
              And if you say the Spirit, 
              you name God the Father, 
              by whom he proceeds, 
              and the Son, 
              of which it is the Spirit.
              Whence, with authority joined to reason, 
              the Lord says: 
              <cit>

                  But you were baptized in the Holy Spirit

          From which he indicates, 
          we are able rightly to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-d1e137">
          From these things you have understood opening, 
          that baptism is truly possible in the name of Christ; 
          where nevertheless it seems to be insinuated, 
          that true baptism is able to be given 
          in the name of the Father alone, 
          or the Holy Spirit alone, 
          if the one who baptizes, holds the faith of the Trinity, 
          which is understood 
          in one of their names. 
          But if someone, 
          believing perversely and 
          intending to introduce error, 
          names only one of the three, 
          then the mystery is not fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-d1e140">
          For truly he says,
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-Qd1e142">
              having named the three persons, 
              the mystery is still empty, 
              if the one baptizing diminishes 
              the power of the Father or the Son or the Holy Spirit
            </quote>
            <bibl>Ambrosius, De spiritu sancto, I, c. 3., n. 42 </bibl>
          </cit>, 
          that is, holding a bad opinion about the power of one of them, 
          not believing one power of the three, 
          this should be understood about him who 
          does not intend
          <pb ed="#Qb" n="758"/>
          to baptize nor to believe in baptism,
          who not only lacks faith, 
          but also does not have the intention of baptizing.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c4-d1e146">
          Therefore 
          the one who baptizes in the name of Christ, 
          baptizes in the name of the Trinity, 
          since it is understood there. 
          Nevertheless, 
          it is safer, to name the three persons there, 
          that is to say: in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 
          not in names, but in one name, 
          that is in the invocation or in the confession of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; 
          for there the Trinity is invoked, 
          such that it works there invisibly in itself, 
          just as it is visible worked through the minister. 
          But if it is done in names, 
          then the sacrament is not there 
          because the form is not kept.
