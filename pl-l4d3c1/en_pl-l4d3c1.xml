          After these things, it should be seen, 
          what is baptism, 
          and what is its form, 
          and when was it instituted, 
          and what was the cause of its institution.

        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c1-d1e118">
          Baptism is called a dipping, 
          that is an exterior cleaning of the body 
          made under a prescribed form of words. 
          For if the cleaning is without the words, 
          then it is not a sacrament, 
          but when the word is joined to the element, 
          then it becomes a sacrament, 
          nor is the element itself the sacrament, 
          but rather the cleaning done in the element.

              the baptism is consecrated by the word; 
              remove the word, 
              what is left 
              except the water? 
              Add the word to the element, 
              and it becomes a sacrament. 
              Whence is the power of water so great 
              as to touch the body and wash the heart, 
              unless by the word? 
              not because it is said, 
              but because it is believed. 
              For in the word there is both the passing sound,
              and the lingering power

          Therefore, 
          the sacrament of baptism consists in two things, 
          namely in the word and the element. 
          Therefore even if other things, 
          which are instituted for decorum, are missing, 
          it is not therefore a less true or holy sacrament, 
          if the word and the element are there.
          For in this sacrament and in others 
          it is customary for somethings to be done 
          for the decorum and the honor of the sacrament, 
          and other things are done pertaining to the substance 
          and the cause of the sacrament. 
          Concerning the substance of this sacrament 
          there is the word and the element,
          everything else pertains to its solemnity.
