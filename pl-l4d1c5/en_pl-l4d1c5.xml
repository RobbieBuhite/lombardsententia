        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-d1e115">
          The sacraments have been instituted from three reasons: 
          in order to humble, for instruction, and for training.
          <!-- passage copies from Hugh of St. Victor; see info file -->
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-d1e119">
          In order to humble, 
          such that while man,
          standing in reverence according to the command of the creator,
          subjects himself, 
          to sensible things, 
          which are below him in nature, 
          from this humility and obedience 
          he pleases God more greatly and 
          earns merit from him,
          by whose command he seeks salvation 
          amoung things inferior to himself, 
          even though this salvation does not come from these things
          but from God through them.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-d1e123">
          It has also been instituted on account of instruction, 
          such that through the fact that is considered 
          externally in a visible species, 
          the mind would be instructed to discern 
          the invisible power that is internal.
          For man, who before sin saw God without an intermediary,
          through sin has become dim <!-- translating "hebuit" from hebere, hebeo, needs dbcheck -->
          such that he cannot grasp the divine, 
          unless he is trained <!-- exercitatus --> 
          with human things.
          <!-- some people seem to translate this "unless he leave human things, 
            but why not "stirred up with human things" since the point seems to be that after sin 
            he cannot longer see the divine except through visible pointers to the invisible 
          
          One commentator writes "Senteces manuscripts have both variants, "exercitatus" and "excitatus" 
          (the difference is a stroke above the letters 
          marking the syllable -er-). Obviously, the intended meaning (and hence the correct from) is "humanis excitatus" 
          that is "leaving behind human things" (humana) when thriving for the divine - as hugh taugh. 
          The Form of "Humanis exercitatus" means the precise opposite of the idea, "dealing with" or "exercise in" human things. 
          This scribal error must derive from the noun of the next adjacent sentence: "Humanis excitatus. Propter exercitationem similiter"
          p. 182, n. 607, Contemplation and the Cognition of God. Victorine Theological Anthropology and it Decline, Dissertation 2013
          
          This opinion doesn't seem obviously correct to me. 
          
          translations of "excitato" don't seem to fit with "leaving behind" 
          
          rather the suggest being stirred up or awakened by"
          The "exercitatus" variant suggest something similar, being trained by human things. 
          Quarrachi notes the variant. What does Brady say?? How does Silano translate -->
          <!-- this is not verbatim from Hugh -->

          The are similarly instituted on account of training: 
          because, when is not able to be leisurely, 
          useful and healthy training in the sacraments is proposed, 
          through which he holds off empty and harmful occupations. 
          For he is not easily captured by temptations 
          who has prepared himself with good training; 
          whence

            <name ref="#Jerome">Jerome</name>
          </ref> 
          advises: 
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-Qd1e136">
              Always do something good, 
              so that the devil 
              finds you occupied. 
            </quote>

          </cit>. 
          But instruction is of three types: 
          one that pertains to the edification of the soul, 
          another of alleviation of the soul, 
          and another for the subversion of both.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-d1e143">
          Therefore 
          since without the sacraments,
          such that God did not bind his own power to these things, <!-- translation help needed -->
          he would still be able to give grace to man,
          he instituted the Sacraments for the aforesaid reasons.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c5-d1e146"> 
          But there are two things, 
          in which the Sacrament consists, 
          namely the word and the thing: 
          the word, such as the invocation of the Trinity;
          the thing, such as the 
          water, oil, or things of this type.
