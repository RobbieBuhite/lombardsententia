              Concerning the threefold immersion of baptism, 
              nothing truly is able to be responded 
              than what you have sensed; 
              because in one faith 
              diverse customs of the Holy Church 
              impede nothing.
              For because there is one substance 
              subsisting in three things, 
              it is in no way able to be reprehensible 
              that an infant is immersed in baptism three times or one time, 
              because both the Trinity of persons is able to be designated 
              in the threefold immersion, 
              and the singularity of the divine is able to be designated 
              in the one immersion. 
              But we, who immerse in three, 
              also mark the sacrament with the sign of 
              a three day burial.

          For according to this 
          it is permissible to immerse 
          not in the mode of three, 
          but also only once.

          Nevertheless it is permissible 
          to immerse one time, 
          where such a custom of the Church exists. 
          But if someone begins to do it, 
          where such a custom does not exist, 
          or asserts that someone should be immersed only one time, 
          then they are doing something worthy of reproach.

          Therefore it stands that 
          those being baptized should be immersed a third time; 
          and nevertheless if 
          they are immersed only once, 
          they still truly receive baptism. 
          And the one who immerses only once, 
          does not sin, 
          unless they oppose the custom of the Church, 
          or assert that it ought to be done only in this mode.
