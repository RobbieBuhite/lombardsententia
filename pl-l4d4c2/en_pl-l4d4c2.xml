          These and other testimonies 
          show openly that the grace of remission 
          is not conferred in baptism to adults 
          who are without faith and true penitence,
          since nor is remission given in baptism 
          to children, 
          who are not able to have their own faith, 
          without the faith of another.
          Therefore if someone receives 
          falsely, 
          not having true contrition of the heart, 
          they receive the sacrament without the thing.
