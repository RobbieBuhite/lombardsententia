        <p xml:id="pl-l4d2c1-d1e115">
          Now let us turn to the sacraments of the new law, which are: 
          baptism, confirmation, bread of the benediction, that is the eucharist, 
          penitence, extreme unction, orders, 
          and marriage. some of these confer a 
          remedy against the sin and a helping grace, 
          like baptism; 
          others are only a remedy, like marriage; 
          are others supports us with grace and virtue, 
          like the eucharist and orders.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d2c1-d1e118">
          But if it is asked, 
          why were these sacraments not instituted 
          soon after the fall of man, 
          since justice and salvation are in these things, 
          we say, not before the coming of Christ, 
          who brings grace, should the sacraments of grace, 
          which come from his death and passion, have been given. 
          But Christ did not will to come 
          before man was convicted from the natural and written law, 
          because he is not able to serve either.

              Nevertheless marriage 
              was also instituted before sin,
              by no means as a remedy, 
              but for the sacrament and for duty.
