        <head xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-Hd1e112" type="question-title">Concerning the institution of circumcision 
          and its cause.</head>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e115">
          Here it should be said, 
          in what circumcision was instituted; 
          and why; and why it was changed into baptism.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e118">
          <name ref="#Abraham">Abraham</name> first received the command of circumcision 
          in order to prove obedience. Circumcision 
          was commanded not only to him, but to his offspring, 
          that is to all Hebrews, 
          which was that according to the law on the eight day 
          he cut, with a stone knife, the flesh of the foreskin.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e124">
          However circumcision was given for many reasons, 
          namely so that through obedience of the law <name ref="#Abraham">Abraham</name> 
          would please God, whom 
          <name>Adam</name> had displeased through his transgression. 
          It was also given as a sign of the great faith of <name ref="#Abraham">Abraham</name>, 
          who believed, that would have a son, 
          from whom the blessing of all would come. 
          Against, so that with this sign 
          the people would be distinguished from other nations.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e131">
          But circumcision in the flesh of the foresking 
          was commanded because 
          it was instituted as a remedy for original sin, 
          which we receive from our parents through 
          concupiscence, 
          which dominates most greatly in this part. 
          And because in this part 
          the first man sensed the guilt of disobedience, 
          it was appropriate 
          that he accept the sign of obedience there.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e134">
          But it happen on the eight day, 
          with a stone knife, 
          because in the common resurrection, on the eight day,
          through the rock Christ 
          every corruption will be removed from the elect.
          And through the resurrection of Christ, 
          made on the eight day, 
          the soul of anyone believing in him 
          will be circumcised from sin. 
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-Qd1e136">Therefore two things belonging to this sacrament.</quote>
            <bibl>Hugo, Sum. Sent. tr. 4, c. 1 (PL 176, 119)</bibl>
          </cit>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d1c9-d1e140">
          Moreover therefore, circumcision was changed to baptism 
          because the sacrament of baptism is more common and more perfect 
          because it has accumulated grace more fully. <!-- translation help needed --> 
          For in baptism sin was not only dismissed,
          but there neither the grace helping us to do well, 
          nor the possession or augmentation of virtue is surpassed, 
          such that in baptism, 
          where sins are not just destroyed, 
          but also helping grace is conferred, 
          and virtues are increased. 
          Whence the water of refreshment is 
          said to be that which makes dry places fertile 
          and gives already fruitful places more abundance; 
          because, 
          however much 
          through faith and love 
          before the habit 
          someone just <!-- translation fix -->
          will receive more abundant grace, 
          but this is not the case with circumcision. 
          Whence for one already justified through the faith of 
          <name>Abraham</name> it was only a sign, 
          and did nothing for him internally.
