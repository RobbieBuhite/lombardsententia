          It is able to be said, 
          that who is in Christ, 
          that is those who have been baptized 
          in conformity of Christ, 
          (such that namely that have died 
          to the old sin, 
          just as Christ to the old penalty)
          they put on Christ, 
          whom they have indwelling through grace.
          It is also able to be explained in another way: 
          For we say there are two modes of putting on Christ: 
          either through receiving the sacrament, 
          or the perception of the thing.

              Men put on Christ sometimes 
              upon the perception of the sacrament, 
              other times up to the sanctification of life; 
              and the that first case is able to be common 
              to both the good and the bad, 
              but the later is proper only to the good and the pious.

          Everyone one therefore, 
          who is baptized in the name of Christ, 
          puts on Christ either through a perception of the Sacrament
          or according to sanctification.
