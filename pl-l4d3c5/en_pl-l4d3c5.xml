        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-d1e115">
          Concerning the institution of baptism, 
          namely when it began, 
          there are various opinions.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-d1e118">
          Some say that baptism was instituted, 
          when Christ said to Nicodemus:
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-Qd1e122" ana="#io3_5">
              Unless one is born again, 
              from water and the Holy Spirit
            </quote>
            <bibl>Iohannes 3:5</bibl>
          </cit>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-d1e121">
          Other says that the institution of baptism 
          was made, 
          when he said to the Apostles
          Alii dicunt institutionem baptismi factam, cum Apostolis dixit:
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-Qd1e128" ana="#mt28_19">
              Go, teaching all nations, 
              baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
            </quote>
            <bibl>Matthaeus 28:19</bibl>
          </cit>. 
          But he said this to them 
          after the resurrection,
          instructing them about the calling of the gentiles, 
          who before his passions he sent out 
          two by two to preach in Judea and to baptize, 
          saying: 
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-Qd1e131" ana="#mt10_5">
              Do not go amount the gentiles
            </quote>
            <bibl>Matthaeus 10:5</bibl>
          </cit>. 
          Therefore by this time baptism 
          was already instituted 
          because they were baptizing and preaching.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-d1e125">
          But if it is asked, 
          in what form they baptized at that time, 
          it is soundly able to be said: 
          in the name of the Trinity, 
          namely in this form, 
          in which they later baptized the gentiles; 
          which, it is able to be understood, was passed down before the passion, 
          though it was not yet written. 
          Therefore at that time Christ did not 
          give this form for the first time, <!-- quaracchi as "prius", but ms D has "primum" which seems a bit clearer to me -->
          when he sent them to evangelize the gentiles; 
          but what he gave before, 
          when sending them to the Jews, 
          he repeated again, 
          when he sent them to the gentiles.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-d1e128">
          <pb ed="#Qb" n="758"/>
          Therefore it is better said 
          that the institution was made, 
          when Christ was baptized by John 
          in the Jordan; 
          we he ordered,
          not because he wished to be made clean, 
          since he was without sin, 
          but because  
          <cit>
            <quote xml:id="pl-l4d3c5-Qd1e130">
              with the contact of his clean body 
              he brings to the water a regenerative power
            </quote>
            <!-- quaracchi suggests Cf. to http://scta.info/resource/gd-p3d4-d1e258 or "Nunquam aquae (10), De consecratione, d. 4 (t. 1. 1364) 
            but I don't see a direct parallel; quotation could be some kind of paraphrase -->
            <bibl>XXX</bibl>
          </cit>, 
          such that whoever would be immersed afterward, 
          with the name of Trinity invoked, 
          would be cleansed from sin. 
          Therefore, the baptism of Christ was instituted at that time, 
          in which the Trinity, 
          the mystery of which is made known through it,
          internally baptized  man.
