          But if it is asked about children, 
          who died before the eighth day, 
          before which there was no circumcision from the law, 
          whether they were saved or not, 
          the same thing is able to be said a
          about children deceased before baptism 
          as those that died before baptism.

              Nevertheless perhaps 
              under the law, with the imminent threat of death, 
              they were circumcised before the eighth day 
              without their fathers doing anything wrong, 
              just as sometimes happen in the Church with respect to baptism.
