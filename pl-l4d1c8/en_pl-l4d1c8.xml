          But it is asked about the men,

          Some say, that sacrifices and oblations 
          were valid for them for the remission of sin. 
          But it is better to say that, 
          those who come from

          were justified through circumcision;

          but those

          were justified through the faith of their parents. 
          But parents were justified through the power of sacrifices, 
          namely justified through what they understood spiritually in those sacrifices.
