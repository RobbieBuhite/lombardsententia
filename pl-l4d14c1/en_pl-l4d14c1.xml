          because, 
          if someone corrupts by sinning the garments of innocences 
          secured through baptism, 
          he is able to repair them 
          through the remedy of penitence.
          The first table is baptism, 
          which removes the old man, 
          and introduces the new; 
          the second, 
          is penitence, 
          by which we are restored, 
          while the return to the old is repelled, 
          and the newness fell away is resumed.
          After baptism, 
          those how have fallen 
          are able to be renewed through penitence, 
          but not through baptism, 
          as man can do penance often, 
          but not baptized.

        <p xml:id="pl-l4d14c1-d1e127">
          As baptism is a sacrament, 
          but penitence is also said 
          to be a sacrament and virtue of the mind. 
          For there is interior penance 
          and exterior penance: 
          exterior penance is a sacrament, 
          interior penance is a virtue of the mind, 
          and each is a cause of salvation and justification.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="pl-l4d14c1-d1e131">
          But whether every exterior act of penance is a sacrament, 
          or if not every act which is referred to by this name is a sacrament,
          will investigate below.
