          And of those which are given, 
          some are sacraments, and some are not. 
          For every sacrament is a sign, 
          but the reverse is not true.

          The sacrament of something carries a likeness

              For if the sacrament did not have a likeness

              they would not properly be called sacraments.

          For something is properly called a sacrament 
          which is a sign of the grace of God and 
          a form of invisible grace, 
          such that it carries the image of it 
          and exists as its cause. 
          Therefore the sacraments are instituted not only for 
          the sake of signifying, 
          but also for the sake of sanctifying.

          For what has been instituted for the sake of signifying, 
          are only signs, and not sacraments, 
          just as there were carnal sacrifices

          which were never able to make just those who were offering them,

          says, 
          even if they do them in faith and love. 
          Why? because God imposed them in servitude, 
          not in justification, 
          so that they would be figures of the future, 
          that one might will these form himself 
          rather than offering them to idols. 
          These therefore are signs, and even sacraments, 
          though often less properly named in scripture 
          because they were signs of sacred things, 
          which they by no means surpassed. <!-- translation review needed here -->
